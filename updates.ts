/**
 * Chick Hero Scene Implementation Checklist
 *
 * This plan outlines the steps and code snippets necessary to implement the "Chick Hero Scene"
 * with animations, rotation, and camera setup in a React + Three.js environment using TypeScript.
 *
 * Sections:
 * 1. Camera Setup
 * 2. Model Loading and Setup
 * 3. Animation Handling
 * 4. Rotation Logic
 * 5. Lighting Setup
 * 6. Controls Integration
 * 7. Composition and Rendering
 */

/**
 * 1. Camera Setup
 * - Create a PerspectiveCamera with a suitable field of view (e.g., 45 degrees).
 * - Position the camera to focus on the chick model (e.g., x: 0, y: 1.5, z: 5).
 * - Adjust camera near and far clipping planes for optimal rendering.
 * - Optionally, add camera controls for user interaction.
 */

/**
 * 2. Model Loading and Setup
 * - Load the chick model using useGLTF hook.
 * - Ensure the model is centered and scaled appropriately.
 * - Extract animations from the model if available.
 */

/**
 * 3. Animation Handling
 * - Play the default or idle animation on mount.
 * - Optionally, handle animation transitions or triggers.
 */

/**
 * 4. Rotation Logic
 * - Rotate the chick model slowly around the Y-axis.
 * - Use useFrame to update rotation every frame.
 */

/**
 * 5. Lighting Setup
 * - Add ambient light for general illumination.
 * - Add directional light to create shadows and highlights.
 * - Optionally add point lights or spotlights for effects.
 */

/**
 * 6. Controls Integration
 * - Use OrbitControls to allow user to rotate and zoom camera.
 * - Configure controls to limit zoom and rotation angles if needed.
 */

/**
 * 7. Composition and Rendering
 * - Compose the scene by combining camera, lighting, model, and controls.
 * - Use Canvas from @react-three/fiber to render the scene.
 * - Set background color or environment if desired.
 */

/**
 * Summary:
 * - The ChickHeroScene component sets up the Three.js scene using React Three Fiber.
 * - The camera is positioned to focus on the chick model.
 * - The chick model is loaded, animated, and slowly rotated.
 * - Lighting is configured for realistic illumination.
 * - OrbitControls allow user interaction with the scene.
 *
 * Next steps:
 * - Replace '/models/chick.glb' with the actual path to the chick model.
 * - Customize animations and rotation speed as needed.
 * - Add additional effects or UI elements if required.
